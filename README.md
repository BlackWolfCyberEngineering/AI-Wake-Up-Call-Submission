The challenge aims to leverage generative AI to develop an open-source hardware accelerator designed explicitly for Keyword Spotting (KWS) applications on the Caravel System-on-Chip.

# KWS Accelerator for IoT

## Abstract

This project proposes the development of an innovative hardware accelerator for Keyword Spotting (KWS) using the Caravel System-on-Chip using generative AI. This open-source KWS Accelerator targets enhanced real-time audio monitoring capabilities in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The accelerator is specifically architected to interface seamlessly with an AWS Lambda application operating within a Linux environment. The primary function of this system is to detect and analyze keywords in audio streams emanating from linux platform. Upon detection, the KWS Accelerator evaluates the contextual significance of the keywords using advanced cloud-based sentiment analysis. Based on this analysis, the system dynamically updates its keyword detection parameters to optimize performance and accuracy with instructions from the cloud. This design not only improves responsiveness in real-time environments but also leverages cloud computing resources to adapt to evolving audio contexts, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency and utility of the IoT ecosystem with a custom KWS Accelerator.
